## So what the hell are dotfiles?!?!?!?!
Dotfiles in basic essence are the Unix version of Windows hidden files. Unlike Windows, dotfiles are mainly utilized for configuration of software. The name dotfiles comes from a UNIX convention where hidden file's name starts with a `.`(dot). This convention traces its origin back to old "feature" in `ls` (remember: "Its not a bug, its a feature.") where files with a preceding `.` would be hidden from output. People natrually exploited this "feature" to make files hidden, adn eventually it was adopted as standard. Remember: it's not a bug; it's a feature!
